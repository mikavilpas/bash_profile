===================
My Bash shell setup
===================

Hilights:

- I use vi/vim mode with bash. This allows me to edit my commands with
  vim keybindings.
- A bunch of convenient git aliases
- git-completion.sh which allows me to tab-complete git commands and
  their exptected parameters
- Case insensitive tab completion with file and directory paths
